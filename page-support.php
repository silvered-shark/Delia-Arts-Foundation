            <div class="support-page-block-one-content">
                <p class="support-page-block-one-content-text">We believe music can change the world. The Delia Arts Foundation creates safe spaces and opportunities for musicians and communities in regions affected by war, inequality, and lack of resources. Through centers and projects in Gaza, Congo, Lebanon, Brazil, and beyond, we provide artists with the resources to inspire resilience, preserve cultural identity, and foster community.</p>
                <p class="support-page-block-one-content-text">Our work in Palestine has faced immense challenges. The Delia Center Gaza—a vibrant hub for artistic expression—was tragically destroyed. Our Artists’ Shelter in Rafah offered temporary refuge but was evacuated due to escalating violence. Now, we are establishing the Harmony Day Center to continue providing a secure space where artists and children can gather, learn, and create amid adversity.</p>
                <p class="support-page-block-one-content-text">In Congo, the Delia-Ndaro Center is a collaborative space where local artists engage in music, art, and cultural preservation, fostering unity and resilience in a region deeply impacted by conflict. ,<br> <br> By supporting Delia, you’re helping us rebuild these essential spaces, enabling artists to become agents of change within their communities. Through art, they build bridges, heal wounds, and keep cultural heritage alive.

                    <p>The Harmony Day Center in Gaza is our newest commitment to the people of Palestine. Following the destruction of our previous centers, this new space will serve as a sanctuary for artists and a place of resilience for children and communities. It becomes a haven where music, art, and cultural preservation can thrive, even in the face of ongoing genocide.

                    <p>Our work goes beyond providing physical spaces—we empower artists to act as changemakers, using music as a tool for coping and healing. By organizing artistic and psychosocial activities in areas affected by war, such as Gaza and Lebanon, we employ artists to teach music and engage children and communities in group activities. These programs use the power of the arts to lift spirits, promote learning, and bring moments of joy, even in the harshest realities. <br> With your support, we enable artists to keep Palestinian, Congolese, and other cultural traditions alive. Their work becomes a rallying cry for peace and unity, inspiring their communities and connecting with the world.
